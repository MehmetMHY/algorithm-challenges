# CSCI262-Maze-Project

- Date: June 27, 2019

## Project Description:

Download this project, then open the pdf file called 'CSCI 262 Project 2 Mazes Description' for the description of this assignment. But basically, the assignment was to create a Maze solver using both Stacks and Queues with C++. A good chunk of code was provided by the class, but the code provided was only for setting up the strucutre of the code and the user input functions. The functions used to solve the maze was created by me though the functions in the maze_solver.cpp file and some of the variables in the maze_solver.h file. Please read the class's description of the assignment from the pdf file.

## Requriements:

1) Clion (mainly because thats what I used to run develope and run my code)

## How to Run:

First download the code. Create a new Clion Project. Move the main.cpp, maze_solver.cpp, maze_solver.h, and CMakeLists.txt into your new Clion Project. Then drag all of the text files in the 'text file examples' folder into your Clion project's 'cmake-build-debug' folder. These text files are need to run this code, as the code needs a next file in a certain formate to run. You do not need to do any thing with the 'CSCI 262 Project 2 Mazes WebPage' file other then check out what the assignment was about though the html file. If this does work, still drag the text files into your new Clion Project and create new cpp and h files with the same name as mine and copy and paste the code.
