# CSCI262-Evil-Hangman

- Date: June 27, 2019

## Project Description:

Download this project, then check out the 'CSCI 262 Evil Hangman Description.pdf' pdf file for the description of this assignment. But basically, the assignment was to create an evil hangman game by using the dictionary.txt file, vectors, and maps. This code runs in the terminal concole. Please read the class's description of the assignment from the pdf file.

## Requriements:

1) Clion (mainly because thats what I used to develope and run this code)

## How to Run:

First download the code. Create a new Clion Project. Move the main.cpp, hangman.cpp, hangman.h, dictionary.txt, and CMakeLists.txt into your new Clion Project. These text files are need to run this code, so dont skip up on them. You do not need to do any thing with the 'CSCI 262 Project 3 Evil Hangman WebPage'. If this does not work, create a new Clion Project. Drag the text file into the 'cmake-build-debug' folder. Create a main.cpp, hangman.cpp, and hangman.h file. Finally, copy and paste the code from the files into the new ones you created with the same name. Make sure the dictionary.txt file is in the 'cmake-build-debug' folder, otherwise it will not work.

## Other Notes:

- The dictionary.txt file was provided by the class for this assignment.
