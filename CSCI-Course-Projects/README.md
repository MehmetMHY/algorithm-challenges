# CSCI Course Projects

## About

Some of my early coursework from Colorado School of Mines computer science classes

## Events

- These projects span from 2019 to around 2020, covering mainly CSCI262 and CSCI306 courses.
- Most of these were assignments that involved data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles.
- Looking back at these projects, they represent my foundational learning in computer science concepts.

## Projects

### csci262-animal-project

- About: A 20 Questions game for animals implemented in C++ using Binary Trees. Users can play the game and teach the program new animals.
- Requirements: CLion (or any C++ compiler)
- Date: June 27, 2019

### csci262-evil-hangman

- About: An evil hangman game implementation using dictionaries, vectors, and maps in C++. The program strategically delays choosing a word to make the game harder.
- Requirements: CLion (or any C++ compiler)
- Date: June 27, 2019

### csci262-maze-project

- About: A maze solver using both Stacks and Queues with C++. Implements different maze solving algorithms.
- Requirements: CLion (or any C++ compiler)
- Date: June 27, 2019

### csci-306-stove-sim

- About: A CSCI 306 pair assignment simulation project done in collaboration with Cody Ullestad.
- Requirements: Java
- Date: September 9, 2019

## Notes

- Please be respectful of this work and make sure to uphold your integrity as a student, developer, programmer, etc.
- These projects were completed as part of my coursework at Colorado School of Mines.
- Each project directory contains its own README with specific details on how to run and use the code.
