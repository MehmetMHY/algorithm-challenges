# BoGo_Sort_Meme
BoGo Sort is one of, if not, the most ineffective sorting algorithm out there. It has a average Big O notation of O((n+1)!). Because of this, I though it would be funny to make this BoGo Sort Python program, were you enter the number of values you want in a list. Then, that list is randomized. Fianlly, that list is sorted by BoGo Sort. After being sorted, the number of attempts is listed. So far, the highest value I got sorted with Bogo Sort was 12, (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12). It took 30 minutes and over 75 million attempts...
